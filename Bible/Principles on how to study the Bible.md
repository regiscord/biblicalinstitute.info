# Principles on how to study the Bible

Biblical Principles to Study the Bible

- The correct seeking, hearing, understanding, application and teaching of scriptures is dependent on the Holy Spirit.
- It is impossible to separate the Bible and the God who wrote it  
    - Disagreeing with the Bible is disagreeing with God
    - Not believing in the Bible is not believing the God who it
- We believe in what God reveals about our current state
- We study the Bible God’s way not our own  
    - You can study the Scriptures and not know God – it is revealed by God
- We examine the scriptures to test everything we receive or think
    - Clear separation of what God says and what man says
- We do not add nor remove from His Word
- We read and understand what is plainly written
- We test how we live (true belief) compared to what we think we believe
