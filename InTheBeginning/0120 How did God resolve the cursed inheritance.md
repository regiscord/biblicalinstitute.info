# How did God resolve the cursed inheritance?

### We are born spiritually dead.
#### In Jesus Christ, we become spiritually alive.
We are born again by faith in Him.

##### Eph 2:1
>And <font color="orange">you were dead</font> in your trespasses and sins,

##### John 3:3-8
>3 Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one <font color="orange">is born again</font> he <font color="orange">cannot see the kingdom of God</font>.” 4 Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?” 5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one <font color="orange">is born of water and the Spirit</font> he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 6 That <font color="orange">which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit</font>. 7 Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘**<font color="green">You must be born again</font>**.’ 8 The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is <font color="orange">born of the Spirit</font>.”

##### John 20:31
>but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you <font color="orange">may have life in His name</font>.

 
### We think we are gods, knowing good and evil.
#### The Lord gives us His Word and His Spirit so we trust in Him.

##### 1 Ki 3:9 
>So <font color="orange">give Your servant an understanding heart</font> <font color="green">to judge</font> Your people <font color="green">to discern between good and evil</font>. For <font color="orange">who is able to judge</font> this great people of Yours?”

##### Prov 2:6 
>For <font color="orange">the LORD gives wisdom</font>;<br />
      <font color="orange">From His mouth</font> come knowledge and understanding.

##### Prov 2:9 
>9 <font color="orange">Then</font> you will <font color="orange">discern righteousness and justice</font>
      And equity and every good course.
      10 For wisdom will enter your heart
      And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;

##### Prov 3:5
>5 <font color="orange">Trust in the LORD with all your heart<br />
      And do not lean on your own understanding</font>.<br />
      6 In all your ways acknowledge Him,<br />
      And He will make your paths straight.<br />
      7 <font color="orange">Do not be wise in your own eyes</font>;<br />
      <font color="green">Fear the LORD</font> and turn away from evil.

##### Dan 10:12
>Then he said to me, “Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on <font color="orange">humbling yourself before your God</font>, your words <font color="orange">were heard</font>, and I have come in response to your words.


### We are tempted by our eyes, flesh, and pride.
#### God gives us the Holy Spirit and a new heart to be able to flee temptation. We need to walk by the Spirit.
#### God will not allow a temptation greater than we can handle.

##### Mat 26:41 
><font color="orange">Keep watching and praying</font> that you may not enter into temptation; <font color="orange">the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak</font>

##### Luke 22:40
>When He arrived at the place, He said to them, “<font color="orange">Pray that you may not enter into temptation.</font>”

##### 1 Cor 10:13-14
><font color="orange">No temptation has overtaken you</font> but such as is common to man; and <font color="orange">God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.</font>
14 Therefore, my beloved, <font color="orange">flee from idolatry</font>.

##### 1 Cor 6:18
><font color="orange">Flee immorality</font>. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.

##### 1 Tim 6:10-11
><font color="orange">For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil</font>, and some by longing for it have <font color="orange">wandered away from the faith</font> and pierced themselves with many griefs.
>11 But <font color="orange">flee from these things</font>, you man of God, and <font color="orange">pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance and gentleness</font>.

##### Jam 4:7
><font color="orange">Submit therefore to God</font>. <font color="green">Resist the devil and he will flee from you</font>.


### What should we do?

##### 1 John 2:16-17
>16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17 The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who <font color="orange">does the will of God</font> lives forever.

#####  1 Pe 2:11
>Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to <font color="orange">abstain from fleshly lusts</font> which wage war against the soul.

##### 1 Pe 4:1-2
>1 Therefore, since <font color="orange">Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose</font>, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, 2 so as <font color="orange">to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the <strong>will of God</strong></font>.

##### 1 Th 1:2
>We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers; 3 constantly bearing in mind your <font color="orange">work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father</font>, 4 knowing, brethren beloved by God, His choice of you; 5 for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also <font color="orange">in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction</font>;

##### 1 Cor 13:12-13
>12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known. 13 But now <font color="orange">faith, hope, love</font>, abide these three; but <font color="orange">the greatest of these is love</font>.

##### Heb 11:6
>And without <font color="orange">faith</font> it is **impossible** to <font color="orange">please Him</font>, for he who comes to God <font color="orange">must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him</font>.

##### Mark 12:29-31
>29 Jesus answered, “The foremost is, ‘**HEAR**, O ISRAEL! <font color="orange">THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD; 30 AND YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH</font>.’ 31 The second is this, ‘<font color="orange">YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF</font>.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”

##### Gal 5:22-23
>22 But the fruit of the Spirit is <font color="orange">love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control</font>; <font color="green">against such things there is no law</font>.

##### Jam 3:17-18 
>17 But the <font color="orange">wisdom from above</font> is first <font color="orange">pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy</font>. 18 And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

##### Col 1:9-12 
>9 For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have <font color="orange">not ceased to pray</font> for you and to ask that you may <font color="orange">be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, 10 so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God</font>; 11 strengthened <font color="orange">with all power, according to His glorious might</font>, for <font color="orange">the attaining of all steadfastness and patience</font>; **joyously** 12 <font color="orange">giving thanks to the Father</font>, who has <font color="orange">qualified us</font> to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light.


### What do we actually do?

##### Col 2:20 
>20 If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, <font color="orange">do you submit yourself to decrees, such as, 21 “Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!</font>” 22 (which all refer to things destined to perish with use)—<font color="orange">in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men?</font> 23 These are matters which <font color="orange">have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body</font>, but <font color="orange">are of no value against fleshly indulgence</font>.

##### Psalm 81:11-13
  >11 “But <font color="orange">My people did not listen to My voice</font>,<br />
  And Israel <font color="orange">did not obey Me</font>.<br />
  12 “<font color="orange">So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart,<br />
  To walk in their own devices</font>.<br />
  13 “Oh that My people would <font color="orange">listen to Me</font>,<br />
  That Israel would <font color="orange">walk in My ways</font>!

##### Jeremiah 8:9
>9 “The wise men are put to shame,<br />
      They are dismayed and caught;<br />
      Behold, they <font color="orange">have rejected the word of the LORD</font>,<br />
      And <font color="orange">what kind of wisdom do they have?</font><br />

##### 1 Corinthians 2:14-15
>14 But a <font color="orange">natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him</font>; and he <font color="orange">cannot understand them</font>, because <font color="orange">they are spiritually appraised</font>. 15 But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one.


### Instead, let's do these:

#### Who do you trust?

##### Proverbs 3:5-7
>5 <font color="orange">Trust in the LORD with all your heart</font><br />
And <font color="orange">do not lean on your own understanding</font>.<br />
6 In <font color="orange">all your ways acknowledge Him</font>,<br />
And <font color="orange">He will make your paths straight</font>.<br />
7 <font color="orange">Do not be wise in your own eyes</font>;<br />
<font color="orange">Fear the LORD and turn away from evil</font>.

Also: 
*Ex 22:9; Dt 1:32; 28:52; 2 Ki 18:5, 22, 30; 19:10; 1 Ch 5:20; 9:26; 2 Ch 13:18; 14:11; 20:20; Job 4:18; 12:20; 15:15; Ps 4:5; 9:10; 13:5; 21:7; 22:4, 5, 9; 25:2; 26:1; 28:7; 31:6, 14; 32:10; 33:21; 37:3, 5; 40:3, 4; 52:7, 8; 55:23; 56:3, 4, 11; 62:8; 65:5; 78:22; 84:12; 86:2; 91:2; 112:7; 115:9, 10, 11; 118:8, 9; 119:42; 125:1; 143:8; Pr 3:5; 16:20; 22:19; 28:25; 29:25; Is 12:2; 26:3, 4; 30:12, 15; 31:1; 36:7, 15; 37:10; 50:10; Je 2:37; 7:4, 14; 13:25; 17:5, 7; 28:15; 29:31; 39:18; 46:25; 49:4, 11; Eze 33:13; Da 3:28; 6:23; Zep 3:2; Mt 27:43; 2 Co 1:9; Heb 2:13*


#### Our main problem is we think we are gods, being able to manage our own lives and deciding what is good and evil.

##### Heb 5:14 
>But solid <font color="orange">food</font> is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses <font color="orange">trained to discern good and evil</font>.

We train in His Word to discern good and evil. By trusting in Him and not in ourselves.

#### Let’s take responsibility for our mistakes, and humble ourselves before God, and not blame others for our actions like Adam and Eve did.

##### Mat 7:1-3
>1 “<font color="orange">Do not judge so that you will not be judged</font>. 2 For <font color="orange">in the way you judge, you will be judged</font>; and <font color="orange">by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you</font>. 3 Why do you look at the <font color="orange">speck</font> that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the <font color="orange">log</font> that is in your own eye?

##### Jam 2:13
>For <font color="orange">judgement</font> will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; <font color="orange">mercy triumphs over judgment</font>.


#### Let’s live for God and not for ourselves.

##### Heb 12:1-2 
>1 Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the <font color="orange">sin which so easily entangles us</font>, and let us <font color="orange">run with endurance</font> the race that is set before us, 2 <font color="orange">fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith</font>, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.


#### Let’s seek God for wisdom to know and discern what is important, and not add to or remove from His Word.

##### Dt 4:2
>You shall <font color="orange">not add to the word</font> which I am commanding you, <font color="orange">nor take away from it</font>, <font color="orange">that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God</font> which I command you.

##### Prov 30:5-6
>5 <font color="orange">Every</font> word of God is <font color="orange">tested</font>;<br />
<font color="orange">He</font> is a shield to those who <font color="orange">take refuge</font> in Him.<br />
6 Do <font color="orange">not add to His words</font><br />
Or <font color="orange">He will reprove you</font>, and you will <font color="orange">be proved a liar</font>.

##### 2 Cor 1:13
>For we are <font color="orange">not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand</font> and I hope you will fully understand, and I hope <font color="orange">you will understand</font> until the end;

*Why is it so important to not add to or remove from His Word? Let's get into details in our next study*


### Closing thoughts
Are we dependent on Him and do we accept His will, or do we live according to our own will?<br />
Where do we find answers to life?<br />
Do we seek God or our own ideas, when going to His Word?<br />
Do we add to or remove from it?<br />
Are we judged by His Word, or do we judge His Word (Him)?<br />
What are other areas in which we are adding to or removing from His Word and not even noticing?
