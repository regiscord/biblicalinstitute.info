# Do we read and understand anything other than what is written?

##### 2 Cor 1:13
>For we are <span color="orange">not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand</span> and I hope you will fully understand, and I hope <span color="orange">you will understand</span> until the end;

- Do we add to and remove from God's Word?
- Do we read and understand anything other than what is written?

To evaluate this, let's use the question: As humans, are we made of two or three parts?

Historically, man creates frameworks to "help" in the process of understanding the Bible. In this case, the framework is two or three parts. By looking at man's thinking and not God's, we narrow the possibilities to consider. Again, in this case, it is very confusing because they both make sense in some verses and both don't make sense in others.

### Dichotomy (two parts) or Trichotomy (three parts)?

What do you believe? Is it important to you to understand? Why?

*The answer is both and neither - so the answer may be something else.

It is confusing because we are not going to the Word alone. The final result is that we can't find the answer.

Is this question important? Or not that important?*

Let's use God's Word alone and forget what man says (history and tradition) and what we think and see if we can find an answer.

#### Verse Evaluation
Let's look at these verses to see what God says:

##### Psalm 31:9
>My eye is wasted away from grief, my <span color="orange">soul</span> and my <span color="orange">body</span> also.

##### Mat 10:28
>Do not fear those who kill the <span color="orange">body</span> but are unable to kill the <span color="orange">soul</span>; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both <span color="orange">soul</span> and <span color="orange">body</span> in hell.

*These verses point to two parts*


##### 1 Th 5:23
>Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your <span color="orange">spirit and soul and body</span> be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

![](./img/yes-3p.png)  ![](./img/not-2p.png)

*This verse clearly points to three parts*


##### Heb 4:12
>For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and <span color="orange">piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit</span>, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart

![](./img/not-3p.png)  ![](./img/not-2p.png)

*This verse demands that soul and spirit are not clearly distinct. You need God's Word to be able to tell them apart. If they were two clearly separate parts, no division would be necessary. So, it can not be that they are two separate parts. At the same time, it can not be that soul and spirit are the same thing which are simply being described intermittently by two different words. This verse doesn't make sense with either of these options.*


Let's use this verse to clarify these separations:

>For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as <span color="orange">the division of soul and spirit</span>, of <span color="orange">both joints and marrow</span>, and able to <span color="orange">judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart</span>

*As we can see, the common relationship is that one is inside the other. No big insight, just clearly written. Marrow is inside the joints, and the intentions of the heart are inside the thoughts. God's Word is so sharp it allows us to discern between things which seem to be one.*

Based on this text we can read that the spirit is part of the soul like the marrow is part of the joint. You can have a bone without marrow, and it would be dead.

#### Let's validate this option with the verses we mentioned before and others to see if it makes sense:

![](./img/3p-in-2p.png)

##### Psalm 31:9
>My eye is wasted away from grief, my <span color="orange">soul</span> and my <span color="orange">body</span> also.

##### Mat 10:28
>Do not fear those who kill the <span color="orange">body</span> but are unable to kill the <span color="orange">soul</span>; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both <span color="orange">soul</span> and <span color="orange">body</span> in hell.

##### 1 Th 5:23
>Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your <span color="orange">spirit and soul and body</span> be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

##### John 3:3-8
>3 Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is <span color="orange">born again</span> he <span color="orange">cannot see the kingdom of God</span>.” 
>4 Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?” 5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one <span color="orange">is born of water and the Spirit</span> he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 6 <span color="orange">That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is <strong>spirit</strong>.</span> 7 Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ 8 The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is <span color="orange">everyone who is born of the Spirit</span>.”

##### John 1:12-13
>12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name, 13 <span color="orange">who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</span>

##### John 6:63
>It is the <span color="orange">Spirit who gives life</span>; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. 64 But there are some of you <span color="orange">who do not believe</span>.”

##### Col 2:13-14
>13 When you were <span color="orange">dead in your transgressions</span> and the uncircumcision of your flesh, <span color="orange">He made you alive</span> together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, 14 having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.

##### Rom 8:16
>The <span color="orange">Spirit</span> Himself testifies with <span color="orange">our spirit</span> that we are children of God,

##### Jam 2:26
>For just as the <span color="orange">body without the spirit is dead</span>, so also faith without works is dead.

##### Eph 2:1
>And <span color="orange">you were dead</span> in your trespasses and sins,

##### Isa 42:5
> Thus says God the LORD,<br />
  Who created the heavens and stretched them out,<br />
  Who spread out the earth and its offspring,<br />
  Who gives <span color="orange">breath</span> to the people on it<br />
  <span color="orange">And <strong>spirit</strong></span> to those who walk in it,

##### Eze 11:19
>And I will give them one heart, and put a <span color="orange">new spirit within them</span>. And I will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,

##### Eze 18:31
>Cast away from you all your transgressions which you have committed and make yourselves <span color="orange">a new heart and a new spirit</span>! For why will you die, O house of Israel?

##### Eze 36:26-27
>26 Moreover, I will give you <span color="orange">a new heart and put a new spirit</span> within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 I will put <span color="orange">My Spirit within you</span> and <span color="green">cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances</span>.

##### Eze 37:1-10
>The hand of the LORD was upon me, and He brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones. 2 He caused me to pass among them round about, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley; and lo, they were <span color="orange">very dry</span>. 3 He said to me, “Son of man, <span color="orange">can these bones live?</span>” And I answered, “O Lord GOD, You know.” 4 Again He said to me, “Prophesy over these bones and say to them, ‘O dry bones, <span color="orange">hear the word</span> of the LORD.’ 5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones, ‘Behold, I will cause breath to enter you that <span color="orange">you may come to life</span>. 6 I will put sinews on you, make flesh grow back on you, cover you with skin and put breath in you that you may come alive; and <span color="orange">you will know that I am the LORD</span>.’ ”
>7 So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; <span color="orange">and the bones came together, bone to its bone</span>. 8 And I looked, and behold, sinews were on them, and flesh grew and skin covered them; <span color="orange">but there was no breath in them</span>. 9 Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they come to life.” ’ ” 10 So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and <span color="orange">they came to life and stood on their feet</span>, an exceedingly great army.
>11 Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they say, ‘<span color="green">Our bones are dried up and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off.</span>’ 12 Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. 13 Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, My people. 14 <span color="orange">I will put My Spirit within you and you will come to life</span>, and I will place you on your own land. <span color="orange">Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken and done it,</span>” declares the LORD.’ ”

##### Rev 3:1
>“To the angel of the church in Sardis write:<br />
He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars, says this: ‘<span color="orange">I know your deeds</span>, that you have a name that <span color="orange">you are alive, but you are dead</span>.


### Spiritual Death
Happened in the same day Adam ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<br />
We become spiritually alive with our new birth from the Holy Spirit when we are saved by Jesus.

##### Gen 2:15
>Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it. 16 The LORD God commanded the man, saying, “From any tree of the garden you may eat freely; 17 but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for <span color="orange">in the day</span> that you eat from it <span color="orange">you will surely die</span>.”

##### Col 2:13
>When <span color="orange">you were dead</span> in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions,


### Physical death
Happens because we lost access to the tree of life.

##### Gen 3:22-24
>Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and <span color="orange">take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever</span>”— 23 therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken. 24 So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.


### A very important question
Who do you believe? God or the serpent?

##### Gen 2:15
>Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it. 16 The LORD God commanded the man, saying, “From any tree of the garden you may eat freely; 17 but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for <span color="orange"><strong>in the day</strong> that you eat from it you will surely die</span>.”

##### Gen 3:4
>The serpent said to the woman, “<span color="orange">You surely will not die</span>! 5 For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”


### Conclusion
We can clearly understand the new birth Jesus talked about. It was a spiritual birth, necessary because of spiritual death. We can clearly understand the new spirit God promised. Salvation becomes very clear when we understand what happened to Adam, and consequently to us, when we read and understand what is written.<br />
We can see very clearly too that what God told Adam surely happened in the same day.<br />
To believe in God is to believe in His Word. To believe in God's Word is to believe in Him. You can't believe in God and disbelieve His Word at the same time. They are inseparable.<br />
We should focus on reading and understanding. If we lack understanding let's ask God.<br />
Let's make sure we seek God's help to know how to study His Word. Being careful to not add to or remove from it, and to read and understand what is plainly written.<br />
Creating a method to make sense of the Bible doesn't help but just adds to it. We will study in detail how to get understanding, discernment, wisdom, and the knowledge of God. As a preview you can look at Prov 2.
