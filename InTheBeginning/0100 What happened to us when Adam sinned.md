# What happened to us when Adam sinned?

##### Genesis 2:9
>9 Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the <font color="orange">tree of life</font> also in the midst of the garden, and the <font color="orange">tree of the knowledge of good and evil</font>.

*Two special trees*


##### Genesis 2:15-17
>15 Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it. 16 The LORD God commanded the man, saying, “<font color="orange">From any tree of the garden you may eat freely</font>; 17 but from the <font color="orange">tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat</font>, for <font color="orange">in the day</font> that you eat from it <font color="orange">you will surely die</font>.”

*Simple, clear, and unique command with a specific consequence*


##### Genesis 3:1-5
>1 Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Indeed, has God said, ‘<font color="orange">You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?</font>” 2 The woman said to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3 but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it <font color="orange">or touch it</font>, or you will die.’ ” 4 The serpent said to the woman, “<font color="orange">You surely will not die!</font> 5 For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and <font color="orange">you will be like God, knowing good and evil.</font>”

*Satan added to and removed from, and twisted what God said.
Satan also made false promises.
Eve added to it.
Adam didn’t pay that much attention, because Eve got it wrong. 
	Either he taught her wrong, or she didn’t understand him.
Are we caring enough to not do the same today?*


##### Genesis 3:6
>6 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was <font color="orange">desirable to make one wise</font>, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.

*Satan fell, because he wanted to be like God.
It was also appealing to Adam and Eve.*


##### Genesis 2:9
>2:9 Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is <font color="orange">pleasing to the sight and good for food</font>; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
##### Genesis 3:4-5
>3:4 The serpent said to the woman, “You surely will not die! 5 For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and <font color="orange">you will be like God, knowing good and evil</font>.”

*Before they had pleasure with their eyes and enjoyed the food, but were not like God.
Being like God was new, knowing good and evil.*


##### Genesis 3:6
>6 When the woman saw that the tree was <font color="orange">good for food</font>, and that it was a <font color="orange">delight to the eyes</font>, and that the tree was <font color="orange">desirable to make one wise</font>, she took from its fruit and <font color="orange">ate</font>; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he <font color="orange">ate</font>. 
*Satan tempted Eve the same way he tempted Jesus.
Lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh, and pride of life.
They both disobeyed God*


##### Genesis 3:7
>7 Then the <font color="orange">eyes of both of them were opened</font>, and they <font color="orange">knew that they were naked</font>; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.
>8 They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife <font color="orange">hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God</font> among the trees of the garden. 9 Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?” 10 He said, “I heard the sound of You in the garden, and <font color="orange">I was afraid</font> because I was naked; so I hid myself.”

*The consequence:
**Spiritual death**
	Happened in the same day like God warned
	Separation from God	
	Independence from God
Fear*


##### Genesis 3:22-24
>22 Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and <font color="orange">take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever</font>”— 23 therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken. 24 So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden <font color="orange">He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword</font> which turned every direction <font color="orange">to guard the way to the tree of life</font>.

**Physical death** *happened later because they lost access to the tree of life.
They could live forever after their disobedience.
Death came in but they died later is different of in the day they ate they surely died.*


##### Genesis 2:15-17
>2:15 Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it. 16 The LORD God commanded the man, saying, “From any tree of the garden you may eat freely; 17 <font color="orange">but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat</font>, for <font color="orange">in the day</font> that you eat from it <font color="orange">you will surely die</font>.”
##### Genesis 3:4-5
>3:4 <font color="orange">The serpent said to the woman, “You surely will not die!</font> 5 For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, <font color="orange">and you will be like God, knowing good and evil</font>.”

*Who did they believe?
Who do we believe?
Is getting it right important to us?*


##### Genesis 3:11
>11 And He said, “<font color="green">Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?</font>” 12 The man said, “<font color="orange">The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate.</font>” 13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, “<font color="green">What is this you have done?</font>” And the woman said, “<font color="orange">The serpent deceived me, and I ate.</font>”

The effects of their disobedience?
Adam totally ignored God’s first question.
They answered based on what was important to them.
Both shifted the blame to somebody else, and Adam ultimately blamed God.


##### The consequences of the Fall to all
*We are born spiritually dead.
We think we are gods, knowing good and evil.
	We trust ourselves and not God.
	We judge God.
We are tempted by the lust of our eyes and flesh and pride of life.
Because of these, our decisions are wrong.
We search for knowledge and understanding in our own ways (based on what we think is right or wrong, good or evil).*


##### Why is it so hard to know the truth?
*Like Adam, Eve, and Satan, we add to or remove from what God says.
We don’t give importance to what He says.
We don’t trust (have faith) in what He says.
We don’t accept what God says or His will.*
