# How to discern between good and evil

### The clear problem

1 Kings 3:9-14
 >9 So <font color="orange">give</font> Your servant an <font color="orange">understanding heart to judge</font> Your people <font color="orange">to discern between good and evil</font>. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”
  10 It was pleasing in the sight of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing. 11 God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself long life, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself <font color="orange">discernment to understand justice</font>, 12 behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, <font color="orange">I have given you a wise and discerning heart</font>, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you. 13 I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you all your days. 14 <font color="orange">If you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments</font>, as your father David walked, then I will prolong your days.”

Solomon clearly identifies our incapacity to discern between good and evil. This ability is not learned, but it is given by God.

A few words become relevant in his request: give, understanding, discernment, justice, wisdom, statutes and commandments.

### The clear solution
We can see all these words in one verse.

Proverbs 2:1-12
>1 My son, if you will receive <font color="#0070C0">my words</font><br />
And treasure <font color="#0070C0">my commandments</font> within you,<br />
2 Make your ear attentive to <font color="#A2CF49">wisdom</font>,<br />
Incline your heart to <font color="#CF8B03">understanding</font>;<br />
3 For if you cry for <font color="#608F3D">discernment</font>,<br />
Lift your voice for <font color="#CF8B03">understanding</font>;<br />
4 If you seek her as silver<br />
And search for her as for hidden treasures;<br />
5 **Then** you will <font color="#608F3D">discern</font> the <font color="#229E80">fear of the LORD</font><br />
And discover the <font color="#FCB11C">knowledge of God</font>.<br />
6 For the LORD gives <font color="#A2CF49">wisdom</font>;<br />
From His mouth come <font color="#FCB11C">knowledge</font> and <font color="#CF8B03">understanding</font>.<br />
7 He stores up <font color="#A2CF49">sound wisdom</font> for the upright;<br />
He is a shield to those who walk in integrity,<br />
8 Guarding the paths of <font color="#49BBD1">justice</font>,<br />
And He preserves the way of His godly ones.<br />
9 Then you will <font color="#608F3D">discern</font> righteousness and <font color="#49BBD1">justice</font><br />
And equity and every good course.<br />
10 For <font color="#A2CF49">wisdom</font> will enter your heart<br />
And <font color="#FCB11C">knowledge</font> will be pleasant to your soul;<br />
11 Discretion will guard you,<br /><font color="#CF8B03">Understanding</font> will watch over you,<br />
12 To deliver you from the way of evil,<br />
From the man who speaks perverse things;

Another term that shows up in these verses is the fear of the Lord. Here we can see more verses and what they say.

#### Let's put them together

![](./img/wisdom-graph.png)

Everything starts with God. Then, He gives us His Word, which is truth. From God and His Truth you get discernment, understanding. Then, you will discern the fear of the Lord and discover the knowledge of God. Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Finally, you will be just and able to make right decisions. Solomon had all these, but...

### What happened to the wisest man?
##### Ecclesiastes 2

![](./img/wisdom-ecclesiastes.png)
![](./img/wisdom-vanity.png)

Even wisdom for him in the end was vanity. For him, everything was futility and striving after the wind.

Why? The answer is in the text before.

![](./img/solomon-for-myself.png)

*Solomon's riches, wisdom, power and all material goods were not enough to satisfy him. Why? Because he was living all for himself and not for God. Let's not end like  Solomon did; let's live for God!* 

### What are your main reasons to live?
Where is your attention? On God or on the daily cares of life? On God or on the pursuit of wealth? On God or on self-satisfaction? On Jesus' Law of Freedom or on religiosity? Are you walking by the Spirit or walking according to the flesh? How much time have you spent meditating on God and His Word? Do you know the true God or are you a religious person creating your own god?

Truth, understanding, discernment, knowledge of God, and wisdom, without faith (trust) in and love of God is pointless and leads to destruction. Solomon had wisdom and didn’t end well. 

Satan knows God and truths and didn’t end well. 

True understanding, true discernment, true knowledge, true wisdom, and true ability to judge, and therefore to discern good and evil, is only provided and sustained by God, through Jesus' work, in His Word, as are all the fruits of the Spirit.

Let's ask Him! Let's seek Him! Let's know Him! Let's submit to Him!

##### Jam 1:17 
><font color="orange">Every good thing given</font> and <font color="orange">every perfect gift is from above</font>, coming down <font color="orange">from the Father of lights</font>, with whom there <font color="orange">is no variation or shifting shadow</font>.

##### Mat 6:33
>But <font color="orange">seek first</font> His kingdom and His righteousness, and <font color="orange">all these things will be added to you</font>.
