# Do we read and understand anything other than what is written?

##### 2 Cor 1:13
>For we are <font color="orange">not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand</font> and I hope you will fully understand

Do we add and remove from God's Word?
Do we read and understand anything other than what is written?

Let's use the question are we made of two or three parts to evaluate it?
Historically we create this framework of one or another and we narrow the possibilities to consider. In this case is very confusing because they both make sense in some verses and both don't make sense in others.

##### Dichotomy (two parts) or Trichotomy (three parts)?

What do you believe? Is it important to you to understand? Why?


*The answer is both and neither - so the answer may be something else
Confusing because we are not going to the Word alone
Important? Not that important?*

Let's use God's Word alone and forget what man says (history and tradition)
Let's use the code 2P for the 2 parts and 3P for the three part options


Let's check these options by what God says


##### Psalm 31:9
>My eye is wasted away from grief, my <font color="orange">soul</font> and my <font color="orange">body</font> also.

##### Mat 10:28
>Do not fear those who kill the <font color="orange">body</font> but are unable to kill the <font color="orange">soul</font>; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both <font color="orange">soul</font> and <font color="orange">body</font> in hell.

These verses point to two parts


##### 1 Th 5:23
>Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your <font color="orange">spirit and soul and body</font> be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

This verse clearly points to three parts


##### Heb 4:12
>For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and <font color="orange">piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit</font>, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart

![](not-3p.png) ![](not-2p.png)

This verse demands that soul and spirit are not clearly divided. You need God's Word to be able to parse them apart. It can not be the option where they are two diffent parts because that would imply no division and it can not be the option where they are just one used intermittently.


Let's use this verse to clarify these separations

>For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as <font color="orange">the division of soul and spirit</font>, of <font color="orange">both joints and marrow</font>, and able to <font color="orange">judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart</font>

As we can see the common relation between these is that one is inside the other. Marrow is inside the joints and intentions of the heart is inside the thoughts. God's Word is so sharper that allows us to discern between what seems to be one.

Based on this text we can read that the spirit is part of the soul like the marrow is part of the joint. You can have a bone without marrow and it would be dead.

Let's validate this option with the verses we mentioned before and other verses:

##### Psalm 31:9
>My eye is wasted away from grief, my <font color="orange">soul</font> and my <font color="orange">body</font> also.

##### Mat 10:28
>Do not fear those who kill the <font color="orange">body</font> but are unable to kill the <font color="orange">soul</font>; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both <font color="orange">soul</font> and <font color="orange">body</font> in hell.

##### 1 Th 5:23
>Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your <font color="orange">spirit and soul and body</font> be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

##### John 3:3-8
>3 Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is <font color="orange">born again</font> he <font color="orange">cannot see the kingdom of God</font>.” 
>4 Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?” 5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one <font color="orange">is born of water and the Spirit</font> he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 6 <font color="orange">That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is <strong>spirit</strong>.</font> 7 Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ 8 The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is <font color="orange">everyone who is born of the Spirit</font>.”

##### John 1:12-13
>12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name, 13 <font color="orange">who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</font>

##### John 6:63
>It is the <font color="orange">Spirit who gives life</font>; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. 64 But there are some of you <font color="orange">who do not believe</font>.”

##### Col 2:13-14
>13 When you were <font color="orange">dead in your transgressions</font> and the uncircumcision of your flesh, <font color="orange">He made you alive</font> together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, 14 having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.
